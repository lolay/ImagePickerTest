# ImagePickerTest
Example app used for demonstrating a crash problem with UIImagePickerController on iOS 10.0.2

1. Open the ImagePickerTest.xcodeproj in Xcode 7.3.1, and build and run it on a device with iOS 10.0.2 installed.
2. Press the Camera button, and then Use Photo.
3. Repeat step 2 until it crashes. On my device (an iPhone 6 Plus), this happened after about 70-80 uses.
